## _Banking system on java_

This is my very first project in college, It's about a small banking system on java. Made in the Apache Netbeans IDE 13.0. Everything connected to an actual database, sql server.

### *How the administration module works*
The administration registers your information as a client and you are given two bank accounts, the first one with United States Dollar (USD) currency and the second one with Costa Rica Colón (CRC) currency.

On the first hand, the administration staff can modify bank accounts, make them either active or inactive or asign a new balance, they can take a look at all their registered clients with their bank accounts and last but not least, they can change the current exchange rate.

### *How the client module works*
On the other hand, when the bank has successfully assigned you a account, and you sign in for the first time, you will notice that you need to change the password the bank has assigned you, so, to continue to the client menu, you will need to do it.

You can get into the client module and you can make a deposit to another bank accounts or a digital "withdrawal". You can see those transactions made in the origin bank account and the destination bank account as well. And lastly, whenever you feel the need to do it, you can change your current password.
